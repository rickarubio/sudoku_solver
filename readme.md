# Sudoku Solver
## Overview
### Sudoku solver is intended as a learning project to teach myself RoR.

The goal of this project is to:
* Learn Ruby and Rails by doing.
* Learn Ruby Design Patterns
* Learn Basics of OOP
* Deploy a useful web app
* Solve any Sudoku puzzle

If you have any tips or advice, that is greatly appreciated.

## 7/28/2013 Update:
I am going to take a step back and learn about more Ruby concepts then come 
back and apply what I learn to the next version. The current version is
capable of solving easy sudoku puzzles, and can narrow the choices for a
diabolical level sudoku puzzle.

The next version (or reimplementation) will be split into multiple classes
instead of being a dish of spaghetti code.
